        <h2><span class="symbol">üéØ</span>Research questions and hypotheses</h2>
        <p>The study aimed to answer two main questions:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>How do people perceive the quality of AI-generated moral evaluations compared to human-generated ones?</li>
            <li>Can people distinguish between AI and human-generated moral evaluations?</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Hypothesis 1: Quality ratings</h3>
        <p>Prediction: AI-authored moral evaluations would be rated higher quality than human-authored ones.</p>
        <h3>Hypothesis 2: Source attribution</h3>
        <p>Prediction: Participants wouldn't perform better than chance in distinguishing AI from human evaluations.</p>

            <li>Screened for English fluency and completion of all questions</li>
            <li>Limited previous experience with AI chatbots</li>

        <ul>
            <li>10 pairs of moral evaluations</li>
            <li>Each pair: one human-authored, one AI-generated (using GPT-4)</li>

                    <li>Moral: "A man robs someone at gunpoint to buy drugs"</li>
                    <li>Conventional: "A person wore a t-shirt to a formal funeral"</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>AI generation process</h3>

                <li>Ratings made on a comparative scale (e.g., "Which responder is more morally virtuous?")</li>
                <li>Options: "Response A", "Response B", or "No preference"</li>
            </ul>

        <h2><span class="symbol">üèÅ</span>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>This study reveals key insights into AI‚Äôs moral reasoning abilities:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>AI's moral reasoning:</strong> GPT-4 can generate moral judgments that are often rated as equal to, or even better than, human responses.</li>
            <li><strong>Human perception:</strong> Despite rating AI‚Äôs responses highly, participants could still often tell if they were AI-generated.</li>
            <li><strong>Ethical implications:</strong> While AI can produce strong moral evaluations, its differences from human reasoning highlight the need for human oversight and critical thinking.</li>
          
            <li><strong>Philosophical questions:</strong> The study makes me rethink ideas like moral agency and responsibility. It also made me rewatch Blade Runner, to see things you people wouldn't believe.</li>
